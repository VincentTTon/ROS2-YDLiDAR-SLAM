This is part of a self driving RC project using ROS2, slam_toolbox, and YDLiDAR running off of a raspberry pi.  This portion specifically was located on the raspberry pi 4 with a second portion located on an external laptop for starting/stopping SLAM and visualization. 
The laptop portion can be found here: 


The YDLiDAR workspace is missing however, it was created using this guide [https://github.com/VincentTTon/YDLidar-X4-Ubuntu-22.04](url)

The program runs using the command: 
>ros2 launch self_drive_bringup slam.launch.py
